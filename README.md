The Unity Cinematic Image Effects are open source and available for use in your games and applications. This document details how to get it up and running on your computer and start modifying the code!

### What license are the Cinematic Image Effects shipped under? ###
The Unity Cinematic Image Effects system is released under an MIT/X11 license; see the LICENSE file.

This means that you pretty much can customize and embed it in any software under any license without any other constraints than preserving the copyright and license information while adding your own copyright and license information.

You can keep the source to yourself or share your customized version under the same MIT license or a compatible license.

If you want to contribute patches back, please keep it under the unmodified MIT license so it can be integrated in future versions and shared under the same license.
